# Bookstore CMS:

## Description

The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. I created an MVP version of [Awesome Books](https://github.com/zmekonnen251/Awsome-books). it that allows the user:
- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.

By building this application, I learned how to use `React` and `Router` with `Redux`



## Built With

- `JavaScript`and `CSS`
- Frameworks : `React`
- Libraries : `Redux`
- Technologies used: `GitHub`,`Webpack`

     - `npm run build`
     - `npm start`

### Usage
- after running `npm start` the website will be opened automatically on your default browser.
